    <h2>Nathan Jackson</h2>
    <p>Hello all! As you can see in the header above, my name is Nathan Jackson. I am currently majoring in Software Engineering, but I also thoroughly enjoy the Web Development I've learned about so far.</p>
    <p>Besides computer science, my hobbies include hiking, camping, and budgeting/general finance.</p>
    <p>I am a full-time student, so I do not have any job or career, but I hope to be employed in the field of CSSE after graduating.</p> 
    <p>My favorite part of BYU-I is how the gospel is incorporated into every subject you can think of! It's interesting to have professors that are able to relate the gospel to the most unlikely topics, such as computer hardware or biology.</p>
    <p>Part of the Software Engineering degree is having a basic knowledge of multiple different fields within CS, which includes Web Design! I hope to be able to use this class to help me narrow down the field of study I will focus on or the remainder of my degree, as this is only my first semester. I am decently interested in it, so this should be fun!</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my entire life, and I actually plan to serve a mission after this semester.</p>
    <p>Anyways, that's about all I have to share. I look forward to working alongside you all this semester!</p>
