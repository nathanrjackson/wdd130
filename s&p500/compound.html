                <p class="calc-text">A compound interest calculator is a tool that allows you to view the growth of your investments over time. It allows you to input an initial investment, interest rate, interest variance, length of time in years, and how often your investment is compounded. It is important to use the compound interest calculator as a basis for your own personal investment strategy, often used alongside your budget and projected income over the next decades. </p>

                <p class="perks-text">One of the most important parts of investing is knowing when to start and how much to contribute. The latter depends a lot on your income and lifestyle, but the former is easy… you should start to invest right now! I’ll give an example to help you understand why. There are two men. We’ll call them Steve and Bob. Steve takes an entry-level job and invests $500 in SPY every month until he retires at 65. Bob spends all of his extra money on certifications and lessons to learn more and make more money. He starts investing 10 years later, but is able to contribute double what Steve did. He invests $1,000 every month until he retires at 65. Steve will retire with about $3 million dollars. Bob, despite investing double what Steve did, will retire with $2.17 million. Money needs time to compound. The earlier you start, the more time your money will multiply itself within the stock market. </p>
