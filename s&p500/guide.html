                <h1 class="broke-title">Finding a Brokerage</h1>
                <p class="top-broke">First, you need to find a brokerage, which is a liaison between an individual and the stock exchange. This will be where you make stock purchases and deposit and withdrawal money. Some brokerages also offer market analysis tools. It is important to do research with your specific investing plan in mind. Here are a few brokerages that are very beginner-friendly. </p>
                <ol class="broke-list">
                    <li>Fidelity Investments</li>
                    <li>Charles Schwab</li>
                    <li>TD Ameritrade</li>
                    <li>E-Trade Financial</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="bottom-broke">This is a simple list, and you should definitely do your own research and use these only as a basis. When choosing a brokerage, you need to pay attention to fees, offered assets, usability, and purpose. Some brokerages are designed for high-frequency traders, while others are geared towards a “click and forget” mindset. </p>

                <h1 class="apply-title">Applying and Account Minimums</h1>
                <p class="apply-text">After choosing your brokerage, you will have to apply to open an account. Steps will vary based on the brokerage you choose. At this point, you’ll have to choose what kind of account you want to open. There are several available, but you should focus on either creating an individual account or a retirement account. Again, this depends on your own investment preferences. Some brokerages will require that you meet account minimums, meaning you always have to have a certain amount of money in your account. Pay close attention to the terms and conditions and opening an investment account, these are important. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="research">
                <h1 class="research-title">Research</h1>
                <p class="research-text">Now that your account is ready, you’ll need to do individual research on the investment strategies you want to use. This will include how much you contribute and what kind of assets you invest in. You can create watchlists that allow you to track the performance of whatever you may be interested in. You can also use other tools, such as Investopedia, Yahoo Finance, and the Wall Street Journal to guide your process of learning. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="account">
                <h1 class="account-title">Bank Account and Preferences</h1>
                <p class="account-text">After being approved for an account, you will be able to link bank accounts that will be used for transfers. This process will be outlined in your specific brokerage. You’ll also have full access to the UI of the app. You can create lists of stocks, change notifications, and even automate certain actions. Take some time to get a feel for the application and personalize it to your liking. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="purchase">
                <h1 class="purchase-title">Purchase and Automation</h1>
                <p class="purchase-text">After choosing one or multiple stocks and/or ETFs, you get to actually purchase them! This differs from brokerage to brokerage, but you should be given the choice of how many dollars or shares you wish to purchase. You can also automate withdrawals or investments. For example, you can choose to invest $500 into SPY every month, without ever opening the application. You can also choose to automatically reinvest dividends. Take some time to learn about the features your brokerage offers. After you’ve solidified your plan, you can monitor your investments and buy and sell as you please. Congratulations, you’ve started investing! </p>
