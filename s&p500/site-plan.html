      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Many people, including college students, are not well educated on investing. So I will create a way for beginners to understand the simplest form of investing: the S&P 500 ETF, which, simply put, is a diversified financial asset that gives you partial ownership of the 500 most successful US companies.

        I plan to create a website that educates the user on the purpose of the S&P 500 ETF and how it can benefit them. 
        
        The website will include a brief history of the S&P 500, how it can be applied to preparing for the future, and specific steps that can be taken, even today! 
        
        List of features:
        Link to a compound interest calculator,
        brief history of the S&P 500 starting in 1957, and
        a quick guide on how to start investing for beginners.
        
        My unique selling position will be ease of access and having many different resources in one place. 
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is people who are new to investing or have not yet started. This could be a number of people, ranging from teenagers, college students, and even adults! The information will be presented in forms that are easy to digest, so that everyone, regardless of their experience investing, will be able to learn something meaningful. The content will not require a large starting capital, so there is no bias towards those who have money or a steady income and those who do not.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>General Overview: The Oxford dictionary defines investing as “the expenditure of money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result by putting it into financial plans, shares, or property, or by using it to develop a commercial value.” There are a multitude of different assets, or properties, that you can invest in. There are stocks, bonds, futures, foreign currencies, cryptocurrencies, or even a house! One of the simplest of these is investing in stocks. </p>
      <p>Stocks: A stock is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a company. This is confusing for most beginning investors. Think of a company as a pie. When you buy a stock, you buy a very small slice of this pie. For example, if you bought a share of Apple, which is currently trading around $165, you would own about 0.000000006% of the company. As the company succeeds, your share increases in value. As the company fails, your share decreases in value. Sometimes you’ll be paid a dividend, or excess profits of the company, for your ownership. The specifics on how those happen get a little complicated, but that’s all you need to know as a beginner. </p>
      <p>Diversification: Warren Buffett, one of the most accomplished investors of all time, famously used the quote “Do not put all of your eggs in one basket” in the context of financial diversification. Diversification is choosing multiple companies to buy shares of. If one company fails, you’ll have several others to recoup for this loss. If you drop one basket of eggs, you aren’t completely done for.
        Let’s look into the rationale of a young investor for example. We’ll call him John. He has heard that investing is a good idea, so he looks for companies to invest in. The year is 2000, and Blockbuster has started to gain steam and popularity. John believes in the values and business model of Blockbuster, so he invests all he can into Blockbuster shares. Over the next few years, Blockbuster grows steadily. John starts to pick out which Lamborghini he wants to drive after he retires at 45. Suddenly, the company starts to decline and declares bankruptcy a few years later. John is forced to sell at nearly a 50% loss. </p>
      <p>ETFs: Choosing what to invest in is an incredibly daunting task. It is impossible to predict the future, and extensive knowledge and research is required to have even a chance at choosing the right stock. This is where exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, come into play. An ETF is a “basket” of securities that follow an underlying index, which is an indicator of a certain area of the stock market. A few popular ETFs are SPY, VOO, QQQ, GLD, and EEM. Each of these cover a different financial sector or group of financial sectors. The one we will focus on is SPY, or SPDR S&P 500 ETF. Basically put, the S&P 500 tracks 500 successful companies within the United States. A few of these are likely companies you have heard of, such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Tesla, and others. It covers nearly every sector of business, from technology to finance and energy. As a business decreases in value or has a negative substantial change, it is replaced by the next most valuable company. This makes it an incredibly diversified and safe investment. It will see downturns, such as the financial crisis of 2008 or the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, but has provided an average annual gain of 10.5% since its conception in 1957.</p>

      <h3>Beginners guide (page 2)</h3>
      <p>Finding a brokerage: First, you need to find a brokerage, which is a liaison between an individual and the stock exchange. This will be where you make stock purchases and deposit and withdrawal money. Some brokerages also offer market analysis tools. It is important to do research with your specific investing plan in mind. Here are a few brokerages that are very beginner-friendly. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fidelity Investments</li>
        <li>Charles Schwab </li>
        <li>TD Ameritrade</li>
        <li>E-Trade Financial</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is a simple list, and you should definitely do your own research and use these only as a basis. When choosing a brokerage, you need to pay attention to fees, offered assets, usability, and purpose. Some brokerages are designed for high-frequency traders, while others are geared towards a “click and forget” mindset. </p>
      <p>Applying and account minimums: After choosing your brokerage, you will have to apply to open an account. Steps will vary based on the brokerage you choose. At this point, you’ll have to choose what kind of account you want to open. There are several available, but you should focus on either creating an individual account or a retirement account. Again, this depends on your own investment preferences. Some brokerages will require that you meet account minimums, meaning you always have to have a certain amount of money in your account. Pay close attention to the terms and conditions and opening an investment account, these are important. 
      </p>
      <p>Bank account and preferences: After being approved for an account, you will be able to link bank accounts that will be used for transfers. This process will be outlined in your specific brokerage. You’ll also have full access to the UI of the app. You can create lists of stocks, change notifications, and even automate certain actions. Take some time to get a feel for the application and personalize it to your liking. </p>
      <p>Research: Now that your account is ready, you’ll need to do individual research on the investment strategies you want to use. This will include how much you contribute and what kind of assets you invest in. You can create watchlists that allow you to track the performance of whatever you may be interested in. You can also use other tools, such as Investopedia, Yahoo Finance, and the Wall Street Journal to guide your process of learning. 
      </p>
      <p>Purchase and automation: After choosing one or multiple stocks and/or ETFs, you get to actually purchase them! This differs from brokerage to brokerage, but you should be given the choice of how many dollars or shares you wish to purchase. You can also automate withdrawals or investments. For example, you can choose to invest $500 into SPY every month, without ever opening the application. You can also choose to automatically reinvest dividends. Take some time to learn about the features your brokerage offers. After you’ve solidified your plan, you can monitor your investments and buy and sell as you please. Congratulations, you’ve started investing!

      <h3>CI and Long-term (page 3)</h3>
      <p>
        Compound interest: A compound interest calculator is a tool that allows you to view the growth of your investments over time. It allows you to input an initial investment, interest rate, interest variance, length of time in years, and how often your investment is compounded. 
        (Link)
        It is important to use the compound interest calculator as a basis for your own personal investment strategy, often used alongside your budget and projected income over the next decades. 
      </p>
      <p>Long term perks: One of the most important parts of investing is knowing when to start and how much to contribute. The latter depends a lot on your income and lifestyle, but the former is easy… you should start to invest right now! I’ll give an example to help you understand why.
        There are two men. We’ll call them Steve and Bob. Steve takes an entry-level job and invests $500 in SPY every month until he retires at 65. Bob spends all of his extra money on certifications and lessons to learn more and make more money. He starts investing 10 years later, but is able to contribute double what Steve did. He invests $1,000 every month until he retires at 65. Steve will retire with about $3 million dollars. Bob, despite investing double what Steve did, will retire with $2.17 million. 
        Money needs time to compound. The earlier you start, the more time your money will multiply itself within the stock market.
