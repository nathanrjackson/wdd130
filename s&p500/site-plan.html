      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Many people, including college students, are not well educated on investing. So I will create a way for beginners to understand the simplest form of investing: the S&P 500 ETF, which, simply put, is a diversified financial asset that gives you partial ownership of the 500 most successful US companies.

        I plan to create a website that educates the user on the purpose of the S&P 500 ETF and how it can benefit them. 
        
        The website will include a brief history of the S&P 500, how it can be applied to preparing for the future, and specific steps that can be taken, even today! 
        
        List of features:
        Link to a compound interest calculator,
        brief history of the S&P 500 starting in 1957, and
        a quick guide on how to start investing for beginners.
        
        My unique selling position will be ease of access and having many different resources in one place. 
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is people who are new to investing or have not yet started. This could be a number of people, ranging from teenagers, college students, and even adults! The information will be presented in forms that are easy to digest, so that everyone, regardless of their experience investing, will be able to learn something meaningful. The content will not require a large starting capital, so there is no bias towards those who have money or a steady income and those who do not.</p>  <!-- change this -->
